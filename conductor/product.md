# Product Guide - MyRes Site

## Product Vision
MyRes Site is a modern, interactive personal resume and portfolio web application. It differentiates itself through a unique "Professional Retro-Tech Fusion" interface, inspired by early computing environments (Windows 95 era), to create a memorable and immersive experience for visitors.

## Target Audience
- **Technical Recruiters and Hiring Managers:** Seeking a clear, professional, and distinctive overview of technical expertise and experience.
- **Developers and Engineers:** Looking for a technical showcase that demonstrates proficiency in modern web technologies through a creative implementation.

## Core Goals
- **Professional Showcase:** Act as a comprehensive digital resume, highlighting work experience, technical skills, and key projects.
- **Technical Demonstration:** Serve as a live example of the author's ability to build complex, responsive, and well-architected frontend applications using React, TypeScript, and Framer Motion.
- **Memorable UX:** Provide a distinctive user experience that stands out from traditional, template-based portfolios while maintaining functional clarity.

## Design Philosophy
The site adheres to a **"Professional Retro-Tech Fusion"** aesthetic:
- **Desktop Metaphor:** The entire UI functions as a desktop environment where each section (About, Experience, etc.) is contained within its own "window" with a title bar and control dots.
- **Nostalgic Warmth:** A warm, CRT-inspired color palette using cream backgrounds (`#f5f0e6`), burgundy accents (`#8b4557`), and amber highlights (`#d4a574`).
- **Technical Credibility:** Professional design choices, structured content, and file-naming conventions (e.g., `EXPERIENCE_LOG.TXT`) that resonate with engineering audiences.

## Key Functional Areas
- **Boot Sequence:** An authentic OS-style boot animation that sets the stage upon initial load.
- **Taskbar Navigation:** A persistent bottom navigation bar for seamless switching between different resume screens.
- **Windowed Interface:** Content organized into window containers providing a consistent and interactive layout.
- **Data-Driven Content:** A clean separation between the presentation layer and the portfolio data, allowing for easy updates.
