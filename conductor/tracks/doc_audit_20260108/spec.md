# Specification: Documentation Audit and Synchronization

## Context
The project contains a comprehensive set of documentation in the `docs/` folder, generated by a documentation tool. However, as the project evolves, there is a risk of drift between the documentation and the actual codebase. To maintain the documentation as a reliable source of truth (and a valid RAG source), we must periodically audit and synchronize it.

## Objectives
- Verify that all files in `docs/` accurately reflect the current state of the codebase (`src/`, `package.json`, etc.).
- Update any outdated sections in `OVERVIEW.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`, `UI-PATTERNS.md`, `STATE-MANAGEMENT.md`, `DATA-MODELS.md`, and `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Ensure all file references and code snippets are current.
- Validate that the "Project Technology Summary" and "Documentation Statistics" are accurate.

## Scope
- **Files to Audit:**
    - `docs/OVERVIEW.md`
    - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
    - `docs/COMPONENTS.md`
    - `docs/UI-PATTERNS.md`
    - `docs/STATE-MANAGEMENT.md`
    - `docs/DATA-MODELS.md`
    - `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
    - `docs/_INDEX.md`
- **Reference Sources:**
    - `src/` directory (Components, Hooks, Lib, Data)
    - `package.json`
    - `GEMINI.md`

## Success Criteria
- All documentation files are reviewed and updated where necessary.
- A final verification pass confirms no discrepancies between docs and code.
- `docs/_INDEX.md` is updated with the latest generation date and statistics if changes were made.
